# Runbook Comparion Utility
These scripts will allow you to automatically check to see if the Public Runbook README.md file is missing any files from the Public Runbook Repository

## Prerequisites

To begin you will need to create a `RunbookIndex.txt` file. This file can be created by copying all of the raw code from https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/README.md and pasting into a text editor to save as a `.txt` file 

Secondly you will need to create an `AllRunbooks.txt` file. This file is created by selecting and copying all of the runbook names from the IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks GitHub repository.

## How to Use

run the `main.py` file
